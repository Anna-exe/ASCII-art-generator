## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:

### **Manual testing**
Manually testing each function by running it in Github workspace with
```Bash
python3 run.py
```

### **Bugs and fixes**

## **Post Development Testing**
### PEP8 Code Validation
    - The PEP8 style guide was used to check the code for any formatting errors or issues. The code was tested using the [PEP8CI tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) to ensure it follows Python's best practices.
    No major errors found in PEP8 validator:
