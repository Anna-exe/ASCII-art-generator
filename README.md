* As a user, I would expect:
    - Understanding what is the goal of the website from first seconds
    - Design that would please the eye
    - Understand what action is required from me
    - Easy to manipulate throughout the console
    - Receive a feedback messages on every input
    - Option to restart the generator and get a new transformed text

### Features
* Colored text
    - To increase the readability of console content I've implemented a color on text messages
    - The error messages are colored red so that user can understand that something is not right

    - Users can choose font from a list or it can be chosen randomly by the application

* Desired text input
    - Ask for users desired text that will be transformed into ASCII art
    - Any characters are allowed, but if user input is empty, app will return an error message asking for valid input again

* Generated art
    - After users enter a valid input, their digital text art is generated in rainbow colors

    - I added a little feedback message that expresses a hope that users are happy with generated art

* Hint message
    - I implemented a hint message that explains to user how to paste the text art to other platforms so it doesn't distort.

* Choice to repeat the process or exit the console
    - Providing choice to users if they want to repeat the process or they are happy to exit the console
    - If user input is anything but "y" - provide a goodbye message. Otherwise, the app will start from the beginning.

### Future enhancements

* I would like to implement feature that allows user to choose the color of text art

* Also, for some users the slowly printing messages might be annoying, so to speed up the process, I would like user to have an option to press the "Enter" key or mouse button that will stop slow-print function and display the printed message fully.

* To make a digital art from uploaded pictures

### Testing phase
